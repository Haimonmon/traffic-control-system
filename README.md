* For the current Map it will contain 1 lane intersection that represents north, south, east, west bounds and can be illustrate some american town roads 🍁
  
* The Map was purely made in CSS, in which the vehicle moves in its ` xPosition ` and ` yPosition ` 🚗

* Each Traffic Light switch to its specific lights of red, green, and amber by their designated timers 🚥

` ♻️ [ Note! ] This Traffic Light Simulation is still in continuous improvements `

* The vehicle movements are only on straight driving, so in future i will improve its turning movements to switch lanes for realistic driving simulations 🚗

* All of the maps will be redesign to avoid goofy design buildings and structures to add more realistic environment 🏗️

* Main Menu will be added for its landing page that will showcase bunch of maps and roads 🏠

* Vehicle AI will still be on its continuous improvements 🚌

* A Demo, Installation and a link visit to the simulation will be shown in this repo once the first map is finished 🚧
